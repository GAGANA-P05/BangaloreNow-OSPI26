# BangaloreNow

### Your City, Unfiltered.

> Bangalore is a city that never sleeps — a restless metropolis of innovation, ambition, and culture.
> But in this endless churn, the truth gets buried. Signals drown in noise.
> How do you know the *real* pulse of the city?

**BangaloreNow is your singular answer.**

We are building the definitive, real-time dashboard for Bangalore.
Not another scattered blog, not another walled app — but a single, living system for everything that matters in this city.

## Beta Release: The Event Horizon

This is our first battlefield: **events**.

Bangalore is defined by constant movement — tech meetups, art shows, gigs, conferences, underground gatherings. Yet the city’s event space is fractured across platforms, feeds, and calendars.

We unify it. Our automated pipeline hunts, filters, and enhances event data, collapsing it into a single, live view.

Whether it’s:

* A **startup pitch night** in Koramangala
* A **concert** in Indiranagar
* A **design workshop** in Jayanagar
* Or an **academic lecture** in Malleshwaram

If it’s happening, it’s on **BangaloreNow.live**.

This is only the entry point.

## Our Foundation & Gratitude

No revolution starts from nothing.
Our pipeline builds upon the foundational work of **@captn3m0** and the **blr-today** project.

Their open-source dataset, `events.db`, was the first step toward organizing the city’s chaos. We extend our respect and gratitude for their contribution.

## The Engine: Automated & Scalable

This is not a hobby script running on someone’s laptop.
Our backbone is a **fully automated, cloud-native system** deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

* **Relentless ingestion** of new data
* **Automated filtering and enrichment** for precision
* **Scalable infrastructure** ready for city-scale load
* **Enterprise-grade reliability**, engineered to run without interruption

The result: when you open BangaloreNow, you see the city in **real time, with no lag and no gaps**.

## The Vision: Beyond Events

Events are just the beginning. Our mission is to map **all moving parts of Bangalore** into a single living system.

Near-term expansions include:

* **Civic Intelligence** → Tracking BBMP tenders and public works to expose where taxpayer money flows.
* **Urban Alerts** → Monitoring and reporting service disruptions like water shortages, power cuts, and civic hazards.
* **Personalized Dashboards** → Empowering residents to build their own city cockpit: news, data, and alerts tailored to their lives.

Long-term: to become the **indispensable urban dashboard for every citizen of Bangalore**.

## Join the Revolution

This is not just another project.
This is a stand against opacity, against platforms that silo knowledge, against fragmentation.

Bangalore deserves **clarity, transparency, and access**.
And it deserves a platform built in the **open**.

We will open-source the entire system.
No closed walls. No hidden APIs. No gatekeeping.

This is a call to those willing to help **engineer the future of the city**.

### We need you. Ranked by urgency:

1. **Frontend Developers** — To craft the interface through which the city is seen.
2. **Designers** — To shape raw data into experiences that inform, engage, and move people.
3. **Backend / Cloud Engineers** — To strengthen the pipelines, scale the architecture, and ensure the system never breaks.
4. **ML / MLOps Engineers** — To transform data into intelligence, detect anomalies, predict patterns, and automate insights.
